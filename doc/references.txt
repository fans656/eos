Here is the first 1MB memory layout when computer boots up,
it tells you which part is usable and which is not.
The unsable parts are things like
    
    - Real Mode Interrupt Vector Table
    - BIOS Data Area
    - Extended BIOS Data Area
    - Video memory

What we got available is about 500KB, enough for a simple kernel even.
